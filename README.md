# Full-Stack Spreadsheet Application

A full-stack web application that mimics the functionality of Google Sheets with added focus on mathematical functions, data entry, validation, and key UI interactions. The app supports complex formulas, cell dependencies, drag-and-drop features, and data charts/graphs integration.

## Features

- **Mathematical Functions**: Support for basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and complex formulas.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Easily reorder and move cells in the spreadsheet.
- **Cell Dependencies**: Support for relative and absolute cell references, allowing complex calculations across cells.
- **Data Entry and Validation**: Easily input data with built-in validation to ensure the correctness of values.
- **Save and Load Spreadsheets**: Save and load spreadsheets to and from the database.
- **Data Charts & Graphs**: Integration of charts and graphs for visualizing data trends and results.
- **Complex Formulas and Cell Referencing**: Support for complex formulas with cell references (e.g., `=A1 + B1`, `=SUM(A1:A10)`).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
-VSCode 
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- webpack 
- MongoDB (for database)

 ### Clone the repository:

### Steps

1. Install dependencies

   npm install react-icons
   npm -v
   npm create-react-app
   npm i react-beautiful-dnd
   
2. Write codes ( src, Components, .CSS )
   
3. Run the Development Server
   
   zsh
  - npm start
    
4. Testing :

   If the code runs , a react web page opens at browser to check errors go to console in browser If you're a MacOS user then click
   ( opt + command + I ) to view console where errors disclosed if exists.
   If errors found in terminal, fix and run. Ensure ther's no errors or crashes.
   Checking the functionality ( such as data input, formula, calculations, drag and drop functionality etc.,) to confirm it works
   smoothly.

Feel free to adjust it as per your project needs and specifics!
